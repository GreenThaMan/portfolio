Hello!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! That's me, on the right! -->

I'm a software developer based in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Currently, I've completed undergraduate level studies at the <a src="https://www.num.edu.mn/en/">National University of Mongolia</a>, and I've set my sights on pursuing higher education in the fields of Computer Science, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.

Driven by a profound interest in Computer Science and Mathematics, I'm always looking to learn newer things and expand my knowledge - either obtained by working on a new project, or late-night study sessions, etc. 

Currently, I'm working as a Full Stack developer specializing in Java for the Backend, and JavaScript for the Frontend

Stepping aside from my professional life, I'm also interested in playing piano, basketball, pencil illustrations, and my latest favourite pastime - Writing! Nothing beats the feeling of good ol' pen and ink on high quality paper.
